# Battleship
Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on a board on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. 
The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" 
at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet. This is a terminal implementation 
of the game in Java.
